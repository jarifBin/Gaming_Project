# The gaming project in C++ includes three games: Hangman, Tic Tac Toe, and Birthday Guess.

## Hangman Game

Hangman is a popular word-guessing game where one player picks a random word, provides the number of letters in that word, and the other player guesses a letter that could be in the word. The mystery word is typically represented by a series of underscores that represent the letters in the word. Each time the player guesses a letter incorrectly, they lose an attempt and a part of the hangman figure is drawn. If the player guesses an incorrect letter six times, they have lost the game and the hangman figure is complete. If the player is able to guess the word correctly without six incorrect attempts, they win the game.

## Tic Tac Toe Game

Tic Tac Toe is a game where two players X and O fill the hash (#) shaped box (consisting of two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines) with their alternate turns. The player who first fills the box with 3Xs or 3Os in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal manner will win the game. In some cases, when none of the players succeeds in filling the boxes horizontally, vertically, or diagonally with 3Xs or 3Os, then the game will be considered to be a draw.

## Birthday Guess Game

The Birthday Guess game is a simple game where the player has to guess the birthday of a person. The game could be implemented in various ways, such as guessing the day, month, or the year. The game could also include a scoring system based on the number of correct guesses or the time taken to guess the birthday.
